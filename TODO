Net/Z3950/AsyncZ version 0.04
=======================

TO-DO
=====	

The 'monitor' option of the AsyncZ constructor forks off a child process
that kills the parent process after a timeout period. The purpose of
this is to prevent a script from hanging and having to be killed
manually--at which point unfreed shared memory and sempahores have to be
freed. 


If a particular server hangs the script, then results from any servers
which haven't been heard from will fail to return. I am working on an
improved monitor.
