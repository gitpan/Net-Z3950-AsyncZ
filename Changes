Revision history for Perl extension Net::Z3950::AsyncZ.
0.05 Sunday May 31/2003 13:05
    -fixed bug in Errors.pm so that the Message "No Records for this Query" is suppressed
      when suppressErrors is in effect;
    -included DB.txt and test_dbs.pl in the scripts directory, supplying over 1000 servers
      with a script to query and test them
    -fixed bug in AsyncZ.pm so that correct pid is found when getting the results from
      a server, in _getresult(); this assures that the correct index is fed to the callback
      function--this problem showed up only once we began to process large numbers of servers
      in one session (with the test_dbs.pl script)

  - Report.html/Report.pod
  	explictly indicated that $all, $xtra, $std are references
	   to the respective %MARC_ hashes-- which I had failed to do in
	   earlier documentation
       added an example of how to create a user defined MARC
           hash which adds fields to the %MARC_FIELDS_ALL hash.
 - Contents.html
      updated index to reflect changes in Report.html

0.02 Tuesday April 15 2003
  - Converted Net::AsyncZ to Net::Z3950::AsyncZ
 
  - AsyncZ.pm  
        fixed bug which result in "Killed" being printed to STDERR at closed of scripts
	which did not use a monitor process

0.02 Sunday April 13 2003
 - Added support for unrendered raw records with helper subroutines
  - AsyncZ.pm
	# params:  string or ref to string
	#   	   boolean: true, then substitution uses 'g' modifier		
	#	   substitution string
	#              if subst string is not defined, empty string is substituted
	# return:  either string or reference to string, depending on whether a reference or a string
	#          was intially passed in paramter $_[0]		
	sub delZ_header 
	sub delZ_pid
	sub delZ_serverName
	sub _del_headers # internal function which implements the above

	sub prep_Raw # prepares the unrendered raw data for get_ZRawRec();
	# param:  ref to string of raw records
	# return next record
	sub get_ZRawRec
  
  - AsyncZ.pm
     Fixed bug in:
 	sub isZ_MARC, sub isZ_GRS, sub isZ_RAW,isZ_DEFAULT  
	pattern was not being checked only names (MARC, GRS1,RAW,DEFAULT);

  - Report.pm
	we now output unrendered raw and rendered raw records:
	  printRaw, printRenderedRaw
	added option to new: 
	  rendered => 1 # default is true

  - _params.pm	updated _params with support for rendered option



0.02  Fri April 11 2003  
 - AsyncZ.pm
 - Added use sigtrap to handle signals not handled explcitly
	purpose: to protect against failure to free shared memory and semaphores
		 if a browser cut off contact with a script
 - Added private parameter monitor_pid to new
	purpose:  to give new and DESTROY access to the monitor's pid, so as to enable 
	          one of these to kill the process in clean up, again to prevent
		  failure to free IPC resources
